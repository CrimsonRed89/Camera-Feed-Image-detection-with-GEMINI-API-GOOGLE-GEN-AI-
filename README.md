# Camera Feed Object Detection with Google Generative AI Descriptions
This project leverages Google Generative AI's Gemini model to provide real-time descriptions of objects and scenes captured by a camera. Each captured frame generates a brief text description, which is displayed on the screen and optionally spoken aloud for hands-free user experience.

## Features
1. Real-Time Video Capture: Streams live video from your camera in a real-time feed.
2. AI-Based Description: Uses Google Generative AI to describe each frame with accurate, context-sensitive text.
3. On-Screen Text: Display the generated description on each frame.
4. Text-to-Speech (Optional): Automatically reads out descriptions, enhancing accessibility.
   
## Demo



## Installation
Clone the Repository:
bash
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name
```

Install Required Packages:
Install Python and set up a virtual environment (optional).

Install the required libraries:
bash
```
pip install opencv-python pillow google-generativeai pyttsx3
```

Set Up Google Generative AI API:
Sign up for Google Generative AI and obtain your API key.

Set your API key as an environment variable:
bash
```
export API_KEY="your_api_key_here"  # For Linux/macOS
setx API_KEY "your_api_key_here"     # For Windows
```

Verify ffmpeg Installation (Optional):
For the text-to-speech feature to function, ffmpeg must be installed and accessible in your PATH.

## Usage
Run the main script to start the camera feed and AI description:
bash
```
python main.py
```

## Controls
Press 'Q': Quit the application at any time.
Toggle Text-to-Speech: Modify the code to enable or disable TTS based on your preferences.

## Code Explanation
The primary workflow includes:

1. Capturing Camera Frames: Using OpenCV, the program captures frames in real-time.
2. Sending Frames to Generative AI: Each frame is processed and sent to Google Generative AI for description.
3. Displaying and Speaking the Description: The description is shown on the screen and optionally read aloud.

## Troubleshooting
1. API Key Not Recognized: Ensure your API key is set correctly as an environment variable.
2. Lag in Camera Feed: Reduce the frame size for better performance on low-spec devices.
3. Text-to-Speech Errors: Ensure ffmpeg is installed and accessible via PATH.

## Help Improve the Project
1. Credit Limitations:
The free credits for Google Geminiâ€™s API can run out quickly, leading to service interruptions. Consider setting up an alternative API or optimizing the frequency of API calls by skipping frames.

2. Real-Time Feed Optimization:
The current setup may feel choppy, as each frame requires a network call to the API. Potential improvements include:
-> Reducing the frame size before sending to the API.
-> Sending every alternate frame instead of every single frame.
-> Adding a queue to process frames more asynchronously.
